    <h1> My Favorite Technology </h1>
    <h3> My favorite technology would be the personal computer I made in the summer of 2025. </h3>

      It took me a shocklingly low amount of time to build the computer, about 2 days in total and around <br>
      5 hours of work. I am very pleased with how the entire operation and the end product turned out, <br>
      although it was fairly expensive. My favorite part, and the centerpiece to the computer would be the <br>
      NZXT Kraken Elite V2 LCD display and cooling system. It's the circle-shaped display visible through <br>
      the largest window, and I can basically display anything I want through the NZXT display software. <br>
      It's currently displaying my GPU's temperature (the big number) in the photo as 88 degrees F. <br>
      The top smaller number is displaying the CPU's temperature, and the lower number is displaying <br>
      the temperature of the liquid cooling system.

      One spec for my computer would be the Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, or the central processing unit. <br>
      CPUs are the main way a computer executes instructions. The 7 for Ryzen 7 means that it's on <br>
      performance tier 7, and it runs on 8 cores. The 7 in 7800X3D meaning its generation, and the 8 <br>
      meaning its performance tier in the 7th generation. The 00X3D means its base model also comes <br>
      with higher clock speeds and can handle 3D-modeling more efficiently for better gaming performance. <br>
      This rests under my NZXT display.

      Here's some more of my favorite specs to my computer. My computer has a GeForce RTX 5070, which contains <br>
      my GPU, or graphics processing unit. This essentially makes visual computations much faster and therefore <br>
      leads to better gaming performance. This is the big metal bog labeled "GEFORCE RTX" and "msi". Another <br>
      important piece would be my 2 TB Samsung MBME storage, which hides behind my GPU. My Random Access <br>
      Memory are the two flashing white stripes, which are DDR5 Kingston Fury Beasts, with each stick being <br>
      8 GB each. All of these pieces rest on top of my B850 Gaming Plus Wifi MSI Motherboard. This is noticeable <br>
      by the dragon visual that exists on the top corner of the computer when looking inside. Motherboards <br>
      connect all of these specs together so it all runs as one cohesive unit. If the motherboard isn't <br>
      functioning properly, pieces that connect to the motherboard might become inaccessible. <br>
